**Build Notes:**

* To build the MediaMonkey Installation Package, compress all files, except for `monitor.xml`, with any Zip compressor utility. 
* Rename the resulting zip file to `monitor.mmip` (mmip = MediaMonkey Installer Package).
* Double-clicking on `monitor.mmip` will automatically start the MediaMonkey installation process.

**Additional notes:**

* Right click on any song, or multiple songs, in your library. Click pop-up menu item `Play` or `Queue` to send the selected songs 
  to the configured monitor program appear.
* Use a second sound card (e.g. a USB sound card) so that you can pre-listen through your monitor program on
  one sound card, and play music out to the amp through the other sound card.
* If using Foobar2000, you can drag and drop a tanda of songs you built there from the Foobar2000 playlist to the Playing Now window pane in MediaMonkey. Hovering the drag pointer over Playing Now will display an indicator that shows where the songs will be inserted in the playlist when you release them.
